It includes tables related to Cleaners, Customers, and Jobs, but does not specify the kind of jobs or services performed. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SQL query that would answer your question based on the current schema. Please provide the relevant table or column names that might contain information about cleaned sui",

The schema includes tables for Cleaners, Customers, and Jobs, but does not specify details about the type of cleaning tasks or items cleaned, such as suits. To answer your question, there would need to be additional data that includes the number of suits or the type of cleaning jobs performed. Without this information, it's not possible to provide a count of the total suits cleaned. If you can provide a table or column that tracks the cleaning of suits, I may be able to help construct the appropriate SQL query."
